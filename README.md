# AI-Driven Guest Experience Personalization System
## Project Overview
This project aims to leverage sentiment analysis techniques to personalize guest experiences in the hospitality industry. The focus is on analyzing customer feedback, which includes reviews and ratings, to gain insights that can improve guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project will contain customer reviews and preferences. It will include the following attributes:

### Customer_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
### Name: Name of the guest.
### Email: Email address of the guest.
### Phone_Number: Contact number of the guest.
### Checkin_Date: Date when the guest checked in.
### Checkout_Date: Date when the guest checked out.
### Duration_of_Stay: Length of the guest's stay in days.
### Preferences: Guest preferences or requests during their stay (e.g., room type, meal preferences).
### Review: The guestâ€™s feedback or review after the stay.
### Rating: Numerical rating given by the guest, typically ranging from 1 to 5.
## Dataset Accessibility
### The dataset is uploaded to this repository. You will be able to access and use it for the sentiment analysis and further project tasks.

## Why This Dataset is Essential
### The data plays a crucial role in analyzing and understanding the sentiments of guests based on their feedback. By processing the reviews and ratings, we can identify patterns, improve customer service, and offer personalized recommendations to enhance guest experiences. The combination of review data with guest preferences allows for more targeted strategies in hospitality management.

## Future Steps

As part of the next phase of the project, the dataset will be used to train sentiment analysis models to process and classify the reviews. The models will help predict guest sentiment, identify areas of improvement, and enable personalized recommendations based on feedback patterns.
